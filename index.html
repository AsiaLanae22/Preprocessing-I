<p>Hello, My name is Asia DeWitt-Nicholas, I am a twenty-two year old web developer. In the beginning of 2019 I have made a new year resolution to break in to tech. Over the past five months I have learned so much from the basics of HTML, HTML 5, and even User Interface within CSS. I am currently a studnt at Lambda School and I love it so far. Although it can be very hard at times, I am very thankful to have such a strong team to lean on when I really need it! I would be a great fit for your company because I am very detrmined, hardworking and not easily discouraged! I am always willing to learn something new and I am a very fast learner when it comes to new projects or even new Languages! I am looking forward to what the tech world has to bring my way!! LETS BREAK IN!
